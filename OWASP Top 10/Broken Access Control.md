It occurs when an application does not properly enforce access control policies, allowing users to perform actions or access data they are not authorized to.


## 1. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

IDOR occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key, without proper access control checks.**Example:**  
A web application allows users to view their invoices by accessing a URL like:

`https://example.com/invoice?invoiceId=12345`

If the application does not verify that the logged-in user owns the invoice with ID 12345, an attacker could change the `invoiceId` parameter to another value (e.g., 12346) and access another user's invoice.**Scenario:**  
An attacker changes the `invoiceId` parameter in the URL to access invoices of other users, potentially exposing sensitive financial information.

## 2. **Parameter Manipulation**

This involves altering parameters in a request to bypass access controls.**Example:**  
A web application uses a URL parameter to determine the user's role:

`https://example.com/dashboard?role=admin`

If the application does not validate the user's role on the server side, an attacker could change the `role` parameter to `admin` and gain administrative privileges.**Scenario:**  
An attacker modifies the `role` parameter to gain unauthorized access to administrative functions, such as user management or system settings.

## 3. **Forced Browsing**

Forced browsing occurs when an attacker accesses parts of a web application that are not linked or intended to be accessible by normal users.**Example:**  
A web application has an admin panel at:

`https://example.com/admin`

If the application does not enforce access control on this URL, an attacker could directly navigate to it and access administrative functions.**Scenario:**  
An attacker discovers the admin panel URL through trial and error or by examining the application's structure and gains access to sensitive administrative functions.

## 4. **Privilege Escalation**

Privilege escalation involves gaining higher-level privileges than those originally granted.**Example:**  
A user with regular privileges finds a way to execute administrative commands by exploiting a vulnerability in the application.**Scenario:**  
An attacker with user-level access exploits a vulnerability to gain administrative privileges, allowing them to perform actions such as creating or deleting user accounts.

## 5. **Session Fixation**

Session fixation attacks involve an attacker setting a user's session ID to a known value, allowing the attacker to hijack the session.**Example:**  
An attacker sets a session ID for a user before they log in. Once the user logs in, the attacker can use the same session ID to access the user's account.**Scenario:**  
An attacker sends a link with a fixed session ID to a victim. When the victim logs in using that session ID, the attacker can hijack the session and access the victim's account.

## 6. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

CSRF attacks trick a user into performing actions on a web application without their knowledge.**Example:**  
An attacker sends a link to a user that, when clicked, performs an action on the user's behalf, such as changing their email address.**Scenario:**  
An attacker sends a malicious link to a user. When the user clicks the link, it triggers a request to change the user's email address to one controlled by the attacker.

## 7. **URL Manipulation**

URL manipulation involves changing the URL to access unauthorized resources.**Example:**  
A web application uses URLs to control access to resources:

`https://example.com/user/123/profile`

If the application does not verify that the logged-in user is authorized to access the profile with ID 123, an attacker could change the ID to access another user's profile.**Scenario:**  
An attacker changes the user ID in the URL to access and modify another user's profile information.

## 8. **Improper Access Control on APIs**

APIs that do not properly enforce access control can be exploited to access or modify data.**Example:**  
An API endpoint allows users to retrieve their account information:

`GET /api/account?userId=123`

If the API does not verify that the logged-in user is authorized to access the account with ID 123, an attacker could change the `userId` parameter to access another user's account information.**Scenario:**  
An attacker changes the `userId` parameter in an API request to access and potentially modify another user's account information.

## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent broken access control vulnerabilities, consider the following strategies:

1. **Deny by Default**: Deny access to all resources by default and explicitly grant access to specific resources as needed.
2. **Centralize Access Control**: Implement access control mechanisms in a centralized manner to ensure consistency.
3. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign permissions based on user roles and enforce these roles throughout the application.
4. **Implement Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
5. **Regular Audits and Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix access control vulnerabilities.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can significantly improve the security of their web applications and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
